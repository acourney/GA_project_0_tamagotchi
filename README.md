### Annie Courney

## What is Project 0?

How to play:

## MVP User Stories:
- As a user, I'd like to be able to name my pet so I can personalize the game.

- As a user, I'd like my tamagotchi's hunger, sleepiness, and boredom to increase over time so the game is challenging.

- As a user, I need buttons on the screen so I can play the game and control what to do with my tamagotchi.

- As a user, I want my tamagotchi to age as time progresses, so I know I've been taking good care of it.

- As a user, I'd like my tamagotchi to be animated so I know whether it's happy or sad.

## Wireframe:
Users will see an oval with a square screen and three buttons.

The buttons can be used to navigate through the options on the screen.

At the top of the square screen, there will be three icons that the user can select to feed the Tamagotchi, let the Tamagotchi sleep, or play games with the Tamagotchi. There will be a fourth icon that the user can expand to see the tamagotchi's hunger, energy, fun levels, and age.

In the middle of the screen the user will see the tamagotchi.

Throughout the game the user will see various popups.

The first popup lets the user set the Tamagotchi's name.
The second popup displays if the Tamagotchi dies.
The third popup displays if the user selects the information icon on screen (option G in the menu).
