## What is Project 0?

## MVP User Stories:
- As a user, I'd like to be able to name my pet so I can personalize the game.

- As a user, I'd like my tamagotchi's hunger, sleepiness, and boredom to increase over time so the game is challenging.

- As a user, I need buttons on the screen so I can feed and play with my tamagotchi or let it go to sleep.

- As a user, I want my tamagotchi to age as time progresses, so I know I've been taking good care of it.

- As a user, I'd like my tamagotchi to be animated so I know whether it's happy or sad.
