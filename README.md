# MyTamagotchi
#### Annie Courney

## What is Project 0?
This is a web-based game based on a Tamagotchi.

You will need to feed and play with your tamagotchi, and let it get some sleep to keep it alive.
The tamagotchi has four life stages, which are animated throughout the tamagotchi's lifespan.

You lose the game if the tamagotchi's hunger, sleepiness, or boredom reach a level of 10.
### How to play:
You can cycle through the interaction options with the "select" button and confirm your choice with the "enter" button. 
The "select" button will highlight the interaction options as you cycle through them.

The "cancel" button will cancel cycling through the options.

You are notified when the tamagotchi's hunger, sleepiness, and boredom levels decrease as you care for it. But you can also check on the tamagotchi's stats and age by selecting the information option in the navigation bar.

While it doesn't affect gameplay, you can use the "change color" and "change background" buttons to change the color scheme of the game.
## MVP User Stories:
- As a user, I'd like to be able to name my pet so I can personalize the game.

- As a user, I'd like my tamagotchi's hunger, sleepiness, and boredom to increase over time so the game is challenging.

- As a user, I need buttons on the screen so I can play the game and control what to do with my tamagotchi.

- As a user, I want my tamagotchi to age as time progresses, so I know I've been taking good care of it.

- As a user, I'd like my tamagotchi to be animated so I know whether it's happy or sad.

## Wireframe:
Users will see an oval with a square screen and three buttons.

The buttons can be used to navigate through the options on the screen.

At the top of the square screen, there will be three icons that the user can select to feed the Tamagotchi, let the Tamagotchi sleep, or play games with the Tamagotchi. There will be a fourth icon that the user can expand to see the tamagotchi's hunger, energy, fun levels, and age.

In the middle of the screen the user will see the tamagotchi.

Throughout the game the user will see various popups.

The first popup lets the user set the Tamagotchi's name.
The second popup displays if the Tamagotchi dies.
The third popup displays if the user selects the information icon on screen (option G in the menu).

## Approach:
To build this tamagotchi, I used a class to build a tamagotchi object.

Then, one-by-one added event listeners to trigger methods within that tamagotchi class. 

When the JavaScript and CSS were handled, I added custom animations to show the tamagotchi's age and mood.
