## What is Project 0?

** How to play **

## MVP User Stories:
- As a user, I'd like to be able to name my pet so I can personalize the game.

- As a user, I'd like my tamagotchi's hunger, sleepiness, and boredom to increase over time so the game is challenging.

- As a user, I need buttons on the screen so I can play the game and control what to do with my tamagotchi.

- As a user, I want my tamagotchi to age as time progresses, so I know I've been taking good care of it.

- As a user, I'd like my tamagotchi to be animated so I know whether it's happy or sad.

## Wireframe:
Users will see an oval with a square screen and three buttons.

At the top of the square screen, there will be icons that the user can select and expand to see the tamagotchi's hunger, energy, fun levels, and age.

In the middle of the screen the user will see the tamagotchi.
